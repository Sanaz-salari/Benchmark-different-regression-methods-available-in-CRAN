# Evaluation of 10 Different Regression Methods
Analyze and compare different regression methods available in CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network) 
32 regression datasets with various shapes were chosen to download and cleaned using R sturio
Implemented a sample size ceiling of 1000 rows to to reduce execution time
Cleaning consisted of removing null values, converting data types, changing column names, re-coded target variables at the methods level given diverse package requirements
The report is listed as a PDF file that includes the comparison tables, a brief documentation of how the experiments were conducted and optionally a guideline of how the R code should be read and used. One of the the most important outcome of the project is the comparison results.
